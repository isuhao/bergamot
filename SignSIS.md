# How to sign a SIS #

Before you can install Symbian applications that make use of certain features, such as KitchenSync, you must sign it. Sadly, this is quite an ordeal.

It seems a signing option called Open Signing will appear any day now, which will make things simpler. See [here](http://developer.symbian.com/main/signed/).

Until then, a self signing guide can be found [here](http://www.gsmblog.net/article.do?keyword=symbian-self-signing).
