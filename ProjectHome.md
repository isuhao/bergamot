# The Bergamot Project - _Open source for Symbian, S60 and UIQ_ #

The Bergamot Project produced high quality free and open source software for the   [Symbian](http://www.symbian.org) mobile phone platform used or previously used by Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung and Motorola. The project has finished, with two notable applications as its legacy:

  * The [Escarpod](Escarpod.md) Podcatcher for UIQ.
  * [Swim](Swim.md), an automatic SyncML tool for UIQ and S60.

If you are looking for Podcatcher, the successor to Escarpod for S60 and what is now known as just _Symbian_, it can be found in it's own [Forum Nokia project](https://projects.forum.nokia.com/podcatcher).
