# For Your Ears Only #

For Your Ears Only is a Symbian app that automatically pauses the music player when the headset is disconnected.

It is inspired by how Android works, and also [headphone daemon](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/headphoned/) for [Maemo](http://maemo.org/).

At the moment, only Symbian^1 (S60 5th edition) onwards is supported. Specifically, it has been tested on the Nokia 5800 and the Nokia N97. I believe it is possible to adapt it for 3rd edition, but I haven't had time to look at it closely.

It does not work on Samsung i8910 (Omnia HD).

For Your Ears Only **is a rough prototype**, and should be improved with a background running auto starting daemon.
