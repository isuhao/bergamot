There are many programs that need to be written for Symbian. Some ideas that come to mind are:

  * Framework for application updates.
  * An [image stitching](ImageStitching.md) program
  * [Subway Finder](SubwayFinder.md) using GPS and compass
  * [IM client](InstantMessenger.md) for MSN, ICQ, AIM etc.
  * iPhoneish SMS [bubble chat](BubbleChat.md)
  * [E-book reader](EBookReader.md)
  * [A decent media player](MediaPlayer.md)
  * [SMS launcher](SMSLauncher.md) that reacts to incoming messages
